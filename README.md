# My Design & Engineering Portfolio

This repository showcases my ability to bridge the gap between complex design problems and scalable code implementation.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 01. Si-Applications: The Student Portal wasn't just a new feature; it was a mission to bridge the gap between students and their futures. We faced a legacy of manual tracking and technical debt that hindered global education opportunities.
**Focus:** Design Ops, High-Density Information Design, Component Library.
- **Problem:** The absence of a design system led to a "Frankenstein UI"—inconsistent components that were difficult to scale, maintain, or trust for production-level stability.
- **Key Solution:** Modular system for seamless cross-platform deployment.
- **Tech:** React, Storybook, Design Tokens.

### 02. LookMix: AI-Powered Wardrobe System
**Focus:** AI Cost-Awareness, System Level Thinking, Cross-Platform Architecture.
- **Problem:** Sustainable AI business models in fashion.
- **Key Solution:** "Paper Doll" logic for optimized AI layering and 70% latency reduction.
